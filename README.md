# MissingNumber

I have developed this console app in which the program is to find the missing number,
---how program works--
. First i have initialized two variables:  arr for array and l for array length.
. Second i initialized three variables for sumarr, total for total of array, and miss for missing number.
. Third showing instructions to user that enter the length of array.
. next is taking integer input(length)of the array.
. then through for loop taking input as elements of array
. then applying logic by subtracting sumarr from total missing number will get find out.
